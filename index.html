        <h3>Overview</h3>

<p>GOLDMine is a browser extension designed to get course data from UCSB's GOLD system. This allows students to leverage their courses (enrolled in, past and presently) in new ways. Currently the extension is in active development for the Safari and Chrome browsers.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>You can download the Safari extension <a href="https://github.com/kpavery/goldmine/blob/master/GOLDMine.safariextz?raw=true">here</a>.
The Chrome extension will be available soon.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>GOLDMine's current features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get course data from GOLD</li>
<li>Stores multiple quarters, once a quarter schedule is loaded it will be saved along with all the other quarters that are saved</li>
<li>Allow students to quickly look up professors on RateMyProfessors</li>
<li>Allow students to view each classroom on an interactive map of UCSB</li>
<li>Allow students to view the websites of departments they are taking classes in</li>
<li>Get final exam data from GOLD (for current quarter)</li>
</ul>

<a name="help"></a><h3>Help</h3>

<p>Here are a few things you should know about using GOLDMine:</p>

<ul class='help'>
<li>You can open the extension by clicking the G icon in the Safari toolbar (the bar where the back/forward buttons and URL field are). The button looks like this:
<br /><img src='images/toolbarButton.png' /></li>
<li>When you open GOLDMine for the first time, it won't have any course data. To get course data you need to load a class schedule page in GOLD. GOLDMine will automatically get the information about that quarter from the page. After logging in to GOLD, you can open your class schedule by clicking on the button shown below (at the top of the navigation list):
<br /><img src='images/goldScheduleButton.png' /></li>
<li>GOLDMine can only store information about quarters you have loaded in GOLD. To load a schedule for a different quarter, use the quarter dropdown on the schedule page (in the top left corner of the schedule):
<br /><img src='images/goldQuarterDropdown.png' /></li>
<li>Once multiple quarters of data are stored, you can look at a different quarter in GOLDMine by using the quarter selection dropdown. This is at the top of the GOLDMine window, and is shown below:
<br /><img src='images/goldmineQuarterDropdown.png' /></li>
<li>That's a quick overview of how to use GOLDMine. Make sure to load all your quarters so they will all be stored.</li>
</ul>

<p>GOLDMine includes functionality to export your course calendar to a portable calendar file, which can be imported into Google Calendar, Apple/iPhone Calendar, and many other calendar programs. How to use this functionality:</p>

<ul class='help'>
<li>First, select the current quarter schedule in GOLDMine. A download link should appear below the course selection dropdown, which will look like this:
<br /><img src='images/downloadLink.png' /></li>
<li>Clicking on this link will open the calendar file in your browser, which will then be downloaded like a normal file download. The file will be named 'goldmine-courses.ics' and will look like this:
<br /><img src='images/fileInFinder.png' /></li>
<li>This file can be opened in Apple Calendar (which can sync to iOS devices via iCloud). After opening the file, Apple Calendar will ask what calendar the events should be imported into. Once you select a calendar, your courses will show up.</li>
<li>The file can also be imported into Google Calendar. To import the file into Google calendar, first open Google Calendar and click on the down-arrow next to 'Other Calendars'. The arrow looks like this:
<br /><img src='images/googlecalArrow.png' /></li>
<li>Then select import calendars, shown below:
<br /><img src='images/googlecalImportCalendars.png' /></li>
<li>An import dialog will open. Now select the 'goldmine-courses.ics' file and the calendar you would like to add the events to, and press import. Your courses will show up in the selected calendar once you click import</li>
</ul>

<p>Some common problems and questions and their solutions are listed below:</p>

<ul class='help'>
<li><span class='strong'>Q:</span> GOLDMine doesn't show my courses, just a message about loading my schedule.
<br /><span class='strong'>A:</span> GOLDMine needs to get course information from GOLD. Load your Class Schedule in GOLD and GOLDMine will store the information.</li>
<li><span class='strong'>Q:</span> Final exam information is only showing up for the most recent quarter.
<br /><span class='strong'>A:</span> GOLD only shows final exams for the most recent quarter, so that's all the information GOLDMine can get.</li>
</ul>
